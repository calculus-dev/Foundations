# Foundations
Foundations is a multi-paradigm programming language being developed by Calculus, gaetgu, and 1s3k3b.


**Possible Syntax:**
```js
// comments

let a = "b";
let c = a;

// variables with math/numbers are declared with the math keyword rather than let.
math wannaDoMath = 1 + 2 - 3 * 4 / 5 ** 6 % 7

method d(e, f) {
    println(e)
    return f
}

if (d(a, c) == "b") {
    for (x < 13; x++) {
        println(x)
    }
}

elif (d(a, c) == "c") {
    for (x > -12; x--) {
        println(x)
    }
} 

else {
    println("Sorry! #{a} was not good enough.")
}
```
